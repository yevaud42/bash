# This file defines the array of defined aliases usee by the
# '.go' shell command.  It is read in by the go shell script
# on initialization, and is written to by the 'save' command.
# An automatic save is also invoked when using the 'add'
# and 'remove' commands, to ensure the datafile matches the 
# state of the alias list.
